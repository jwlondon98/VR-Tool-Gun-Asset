# VR Tool Gun
The VR Tool Gun is an asset I have been developing for a future release on the Unity Asset Store. [This video demo]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJJmom81ZHA&ab_channel=JLO_VR") exhibits some of the main features that this tool currently contains.

The project is being developed in Unity version 2021.3.4f1 using Unity's OpenXR plugin with an Oculus Quest 2.
